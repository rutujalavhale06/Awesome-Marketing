From 2018 to 2022, the demand for these lenses surged due to a combination of factors such as increasing screen time, awareness about eye health, and the rise of digital devices. However, as we look toward the future, from 2023 to 2033, there are shifting dynamics and projections that will further shape the marketâ€™s landscape.</p><h2>The Market Trends from 2018 to 2022</h2><p>Between 2018 and 2022, the blue light blocking lens market saw a robust growth trajectory.
